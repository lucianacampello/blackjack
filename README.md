# Blackjack Game
### Game Rules
Cards **2 through 10** are worth their face value, and **face cards (jack, queen, king)** are also worth 10.

An **ace's(A)** value is 11 unless this causes the score to exceed 21 points, in which case it is worth 1.

#### Example: 

**Cards [7 K]**

    7 + K(10) = 17;

**Cards [A 1 9]** 

    A (11 points) + 1 + 9 = 21;

**Cards [A 7 5]** 

    A (11 points) + 7 + 5 = 23 but it burst 21, the ace (A) card worth 1, so the score is: 1 + 7 + 5 = 13.
